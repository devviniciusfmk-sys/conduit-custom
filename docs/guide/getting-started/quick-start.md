# Quick Start

Get up and running with Conduit in 5 minutes.

## Start Conduit

```bash
conduit
```

You'll see the main interface with a sidebar on the left and an empty chat area.

## Open a Project

1. Press `Ctrl+N` to open the project picker
   If providers are not configured yet, you'll select them first.
   If no default model is configured yet, you'll then pick your default model.
2. Type to filter your recent repositories
3. Press `Enter` to select one, or `Ctrl+A` to add a new repository

A new tab opens with your project loaded.

## Send a Prompt

1. Type your message in the input box at the bottom
2. Press `Enter` to send
3. Watch the agent work — you'll see tool executions and responses in real-time

## Essential Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+N` | New project/tab |
| `Alt+1-9` | Switch to tab 1-9 |
| `Tab` | Toggle Build/Plan mode |
| `Ctrl+T` | Toggle sidebar |
| `Ctrl+P` | Command palette |
| `Ctrl+Q` | Quit |

## Open Multiple Tabs

Run multiple agents simultaneously:

1. Press `Ctrl+N` to open another project
2. Use `Alt+1`, `Alt+2`, etc. to switch between tabs
3. Or use `Alt+Tab` / `Alt+Shift+Tab` to cycle through

Each tab runs independently — you can have Codex working on one task while Claude handles another.

## Toggle Build/Plan Mode

Press `Tab` to switch between:

- **Build Mode** (default) — Agent can read, write, and execute commands
- **Plan Mode** — Read-only analysis, no modifications

The status bar shows the current mode.

Plan mode relies on prompt guidance for Codex and Gemini, so treat it as best-effort.

## View Token Usage

The status bar displays:
- Input/output token counts
- Estimated cost
- Current model

Toggle the display in settings or with `Alt+P`.
